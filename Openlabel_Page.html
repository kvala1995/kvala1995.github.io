            <h2>What is Open Label project?</h2>
            <p>
                OpenLabel is an open-source Chrome extension designed to assist users in evaluating online articles by
                analyzing
                characteristics such as emotion, credibility, bias, and trending terms.
                It generates labels providing insights into the content's trustworthiness and relevance.
                Before you start using or modifying the extension, there are a few topics to discuss.
            </p>
            <h2> What is our future goal?</h2>
            <p>
                Our future goal is to implement a class to store label categories. This idea is promising because it
                enhances expandability and customizability
                of our system. By isolating label categories into one class, we further decouple the architecture,
                leading to better maintainability.
                Additionally, consolidating label display logic into a single method instead of hardcoding it into label
                creation events will facilitate
                easier changes to label displays in the future, such as altering the display based on label categories
            </p>
            <h2> What is the purpose of this study?</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness, usability, and impact of the OpenLabel
                software
                through real-world experimentation with actual users. By conducting this study, we aim to gather
                valuable insights and feedback
                on various aspects of the software, including user experiences, interface design, accuracy in assessing
                content,
                integration with browsing habits, trustworthiness perceptions, and potential influences on news
                consumption behavior.
                Additionally, we seek to identify areas for improvement and enhancement, as well as
                potential barriers to adoption, ultimately refining OpenLabel to better meet the needs and preferences
                of its users in
                combating misinformation and enhancing online content evaluation.
            </p>
            <h2>How the extension works</h2>
            <p>
                Open Label informs the user over several characteristics from an article. These characteristics are
                shown below </p>
            <div class="ul">
                <ul>
                    <li>Emotion</li>
                    <li>Creditability</li>
                    <li>Publisher</li>
                    <li>MBFC Media Bias</li>
                    <li>Viral Terms</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                Emotion is gathered through reading the articles text and using sentiment analysis.
                Positive words in the text generate positive values and negative words in the text generate negative
                values towards the overall emotion score.
                Creditability, Publisher, and MBFC Media Bias are all sourced from Media Bias/Fact Check. Viral Terms
                are found using the Google Trends API.
            </p>
            <p>The extension analyzes an article when the user hovers the URL for said article (the option also
                exists
                to right click the link to activate the analysis).
                After the user has then hovered over a link our extension will begin to analyze the article. It will
                indicate to the user that it is loading to communicate the URL is being analyzed.
                It is then posted in the form of a label next to the cursor and it will appear as below.
            </p>
